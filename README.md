## Overview

### Description

###  Description
The goal of this app is to connect people through music. The main feature of the app will be a time initiated notification for the user to take a picture. This notification will route the user to a camera and have their picture taken. After this picture is taken the post will be linked with the song that the user is currently listening to and it will have their location listed. This will then be uploaded to a feed that can be seen by other users that the current user is friends with. The current user will be able to see a feed of their friends and people that they are following with the same format for the picture/song/location. At the end of each week the most listened to songs/artists on a user's feed will be shown to them in a list.

### App Evaluation


- **Category: Social**
- **Mobile:** Uses camera, location, audio playback, and push notifications
- **Story:** Provides a clear value to users: connect through music, discover what friends are listening to, and share moments linked with songs
- **Market:** The market for this app is very large but mainly targets younger users from ages 18-30 but will hopefully be used by people from all age demographics. This app will be aiming to help people of ages to connect with each
- **Habit:** Daily/weekly usage expected. Users will regularly receive notifications, post pictures, and check their feed
- **Scope:** Core functionality is feasible for an MVP (camera + song linking + feed) and advanced features (analytics, trends, gamification) can be added later if needed

* Recommendation Tab: The user recommendations tab should be the furthest tab from the user and it should link to the page showing the list of user recommendations
*  Friends Page: There should be a friends page where a user can search usernames to add people or there will be a recommendation of who they should add based on their current friends and this page can also store who added the user and allow them to add them back
* Profile Page: This should show the user their music listening stats and what artists/songs they are listening to the most and how many days in a row they have posted


**Flow Navigation** (Screen to Screen)

- Camera -> Feed
    - After the user takes their picture for the day and uploads it, they should be routed to the feed page where they can see other posts.
