##  Step 1: Generate New Ideas 

### Member: Keegan Wooding
1. **Grocery Helper** — This app will be used by everday people who want to speed up the process of shopping. This allows the user to be able to enter the items on their grocery list and then choose a store of their choosing then the app will show them their entire list sorted in aisle order so users can do their shopping in one go.
2. **Commute Helper** — This app will be used by people everyday who need to time out their commute to get to their destination on time. This would communicate with a map API and parking API that would be able to let the user know exactly when they need to leave to arrive on time.
3. **Playlist Creator** — This will allow the users to be able to find music that they want to listen to. It will let the user listen to a 15-30 second clip of the most replayed part of the song. The user can then swipe right to add it to a playlist and will swipe left if they are not interested in the song. The non selected songs will be put into a database that will not be shown to the user again unless specifically prompted. The users can select which music category they like or they can have it based off of their top listened to songs/artists. This can use the spotify API. It can also show the user concerts in their area and they can select which ones they are most interested in. This could also have a group option where users on other devices can swipe which songs they want to add to a group playlist that could play in the order that they were added in.

1. **Music Media** — This app acts as a social media app, centered on music where users upload an image of themselves throughout the day, and compliment it with a song the they feel fits the mood of that day. It involves location data which ultimately compiles the top songs that people on the platform are listening to that day, and the top songs in your area. It gives you the option to look at more features about popular songs so that users can get more information so users can decide whether they want to add it to their playlist.
2. **Routine Router"** — This app takes in user data regarding daily routines each day throughout the week, and stores the data in a database. The app then compiles an optimized daily routine, to help the user visualize what their "perfect day" looks like. The app uses API data to compare user habits with general habits and also logs these habits for users to refer to.
3. **Study Buddy** — This app is meant to help users study more efficiently by allowing them to choose the topic/subject they are studying for, and the app compiles study resources including video links, article links, and other helpful tools that the user can use for their own desires. It also features a rating system in which users can rate the resources and subsequently make it so that higher rated resources are prioritized.

1. **Leftover Ingredients App** — User inputs a list of ingredients that they already have and the app will give them a list of foods that they can make along with the exact recipies to follow. 
2. **Wikipedia Locations Travel App** — App that gives photos, historical facts, and current weather reports on a location. The user can swipe through locations like a dating app so they can build a bucket list of locations they would like to visit. 
3. **Cookbook Universe** — Fictional cookbook generator based on movies and games. "The Hobbit's Second Breakfast Guide," "Final Fantasy Potions IRL," "Breaking Bad's Los Pollos Hermanos Menu." Creates real, tested recipes inspired by fictional universes.
4. **Recipe Roulette** — Spin a virtual globe to land on random countries, then get authentic recipes with stunning food photography, ingredient translations, and cultural Wikipedia entries about that cuisine's history.

##  Step 2.2: Evaluate Top 3 

> Rate each idea on **Mobile / Story / Market / Habit / Scope** (1–5), add notes, and check **API availability**.

###  Evaluation Rubric (what to consider)

- **Mobile:** Uniquely mobile (maps, camera, location, audio, sensors, push, real-time)? Try for **2+** native capabilities.
- **Story:** Clear value; compelling to the audience; peers would “get it”.
- **Market:** Size/uniqueness; huge value to a niche; well-defined audience.
- **Habit:** Frequency of use; creation vs consumption.
- **Scope:** Feasible within the course timeline; a stripped-down MVP is still useful; requirements are clear.
