##  Step 1: Generate New Ideas 

### Member: Keegan Wooding
1. **Grocery Helper** — This app will be used by everday people who want to speed up the process of shopping. This allows the user to be able to enter the items on their grocery list and then choose a store of their choosing then the app will show them their entire list sorted in aisle order so users can do their shopping in one go.
2. **Commute Helper** — This app will be used by people everyday who need to time out their commute to get to their destination on time. This would communicate with a map API and parking API that would be able to let the user know exactly when they need to leave to arrive on time.
3. **Idea Title #3** — *description*

| [Idea C] | ✓ | [N1] |
| ... |  |  |

**Top 3 selected:** **[Idea 1] · [Idea 2] · [Idea 3]**

##  Step 2.2: Evaluate Top 3 (App Evaluation Criteria)

> Rate each idea on **Mobile / Story / Market / Habit / Scope** (1–5), add notes, and check **API availability**.

###  Evaluation Rubric (what to consider)

- **Mobile:** Uniquely mobile (maps, camera, location, audio, sensors, push, real-time)? Try for **2+** native capabilities.
- **Story:** Clear value; compelling to the audience; peers would “get it”.
- **Market:** Size/uniqueness; huge value to a niche; well-defined audience.
- **Habit:** Frequency of use; creation vs consumption.
- **Scope:** Feasible within the course timeline; a stripped-down MVP is still useful; requirements are clear.

### Idea #1 — **[Title]**
**One-liner:** *[Who does what to solve what problem?]*

| Criterion | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | Notes |
|-----------|---|---|---|---|---|------|
| **Mobile** | ☐ | ☐ | ☐ | ☐ | ☐ | [Which mobile features? (maps/camera/location/sensors/push/realtime)] |
| **Story**  | ☐ | ☐ | ☐ | ☐ | ☐ | [Why it matters; who cares; quick pitch] |
| **Market** | ☐ | ☐ | ☐ | ☐ | ☐ | [Audience size; niche value; who are users] |
| **Habit**  | ☐ | ☐ | ☐ | ☐ | ☐ | [Daily/weekly usage; creation vs consumption] |
| **Scope**  | ☐ | ☐ | ☐ | ☐ | ☐ | [MVP feasibility; risks; timeline confidence] |

**API Check (required):**
- Candidate APIs: [API 1 link], [API 2 link]
- **Cost:** Free ☐  Freemium ☐  Paid ☐
- **Limits:** [rate limits / auth / quotas]
- **Data fit:** [Does the API provide the core data you need?]
- **Feasibility verdict:**  Viable / Risky /  Not viable

**Total (out of 25):** **__ / 25**

### Idea #2 — **[Title]**
*(Repeat the same evaluation table and API check as above.)*

---

### Idea #3 — **[Title]**
*(Repeat the same evaluation table and API check as above.)*

##  Step 2.3: Final Decision

**[Final App Title]**

**Why we chose it (tie back to criteria):**
- **Mobile:** [e.g., uses camera + location + push]
- **Story:** [clear value to [audience]]
- **Market:** [defined audience; strong niche; or broad appeal]
- **Habit:** [expected usage frequency; creation loops]
- **Scope:** [feasible MVP by course deadline; clear roadmap]

**Risks & Mitigations:**
- Risk 1 → Mitigation
- Risk 2 → Mitigation

**MVP (Week 1–2):**
- [Feature A], [Feature B], [Feature C]

**Stretch Goals (if time):**
- [Feature X], [Feature Y]
